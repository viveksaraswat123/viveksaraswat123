#  Hi, I’m Vivek Saraswat

Final-year **B.Tech Computer Science** student with a strong inclination towards **Backend Development** and **Applied Machine Learning**.  
I enjoy understanding how real-world systems are designed, deployed, and maintained — not just how they work in theory.

I focus on writing clean backend code, building reliable APIs, and learning how to deploy and run applications in production-like environments.
